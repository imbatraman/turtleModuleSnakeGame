# turtleModuleSnakeGame

Built the Snake Game in Python using the Turtle module
- Turtle module draws graphics on screen
- class Snake is used to create a snake turtle object and has methods to control the snakes movements, extension (when score +=1) and resetting it (when game is over)
- class Food is used to create a food turtle object randomly on the screen
- class Scoreboard is used to create a scoreboard turtle object to update the score everytime the snake collides with food (score +=1) or with wall or its tail (game over)
